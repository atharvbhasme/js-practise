# Build in objects in JS

## Things to remember

- what are build objects in JS ?: Objects that are availiable gloablly
- value properties: infinity, Nan, undefined, null
- fundamental objects: Oject, Functions, boolean, number, Error
- Numbers and Dates: Math, Date
- Text Processing: string methods like .length, .uppercase, .include etc
- Index Collections: Arrays metrhods forEach, arr[0]
- keys Collections: Map, Set
- Strcured Data: JSON
- Asycn Operations: Async Await
- What is Date: Date is built object to get date and time and make oprations on them
- To get timestamp: Date.now()
- See the example in date.js
- Math is a static object â€“ use it directly: Math.method().
- Math.random() is your go-to for randomness, but remember it only gives a number between 0 and 1. You have to scale it
- Rounding is contextual: Use round for standard rounding, floor to always round down, and ceil to -always round up.
- Check how to find smallest and largest number in array using ...spread operatror
- JSON is the universal language for data exchange on the web.
- remermber the differece between JSON and JS objects
- JSON.stringify(object) converts an object -> to a string (to send/store).
- JSON.parse(string) converts a string -> to an object (to use).
- Always validate/catch errors when parsing JSON from external sources
- Map is for key-value pairs where the key can be any data type (even another object). It remembers the insertion order.
- Set is for storing unique values only. It automatically rejects duplicates and is optimized for checking if a value exists.
- Set does not have indexed based access
- maps and sets are used to manage uniue collections

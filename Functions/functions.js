// Defined with the function keyword
// Hoisted: Can be used before it's defined

//Stored in a variable
// Not hoisted: Cannot be used before it's defined

Differences from normal functions:
No this binding (arrow functions do not have their own this)
Can't be used as constructors (new MyArrowFunc() will fail)
Cleaner syntax for short logic
*/

// callback function
/*
A callback is just a function passed into another function as an argument, to be called later.
Used in asynchronous code, like when reading files, making API calls, or working with timers.

// Questions
// Can you please explain the hoisting in little deep with examples and simple language
// What is temporal dead zone
// What is working this in functions


// things to remember
// function declration vs function expression
// What is hoisting ?
// Hoisting work for var, let and const, and function expression and function declaration
// what is TDZ ? what is used of TDZ with example ?
// TDZ apply for functions ? (For function declration and var function expression No but for let and const function expression yes)
//  Always declare variables and functions at the top of their scope to avoid confusion with hoisting.
// when we should call regular functions and arrow functions ?
// What is use this in functions and how this works in arrow functions (Note arrow function does not have there own this they take it from
// surroudind)

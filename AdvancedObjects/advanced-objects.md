# Advanced Object in JS

## Important things to remember

- what are the class in JS
- class in JS are blueprints for creating objects with similar properties and methods.
- classes are only avaible in ES6 and later versions of JS.
- what are the contrcutor funtions?
- functions that create new objects with similar properties and methods by using the 'new' keyword.
- please note that we need "new" keyword to create a new object using constructor function
- what happen if you return the object from constructor function or class?it will overridden the object
- can JS class have multiple constructors?NO, JS class have only one constrcutor method. will get syntax error if we try to create multiple constructor methods in a class.
- we use extends and super keywords to use inheritance in classes
- extneds: use when one class inherits another class
- super: use to call the parent class constructor and methods
- can you override the methods in child class? Yes
- what if you don't use super in child class constructor?will get reference error
- can you extneds more than one class in JS?NO, JS does not support multiple inheritance using classes. A class can only extend one parent class.
